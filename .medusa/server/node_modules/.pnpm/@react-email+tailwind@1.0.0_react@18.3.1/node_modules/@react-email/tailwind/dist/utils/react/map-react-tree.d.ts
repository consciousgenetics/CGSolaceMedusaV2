/**
 * A function made for deep mapping a React tree from a node, even through its components.
 * For all the components it finds, it renders them by directly calling them. This has a few issues
 * with hooks, and the only solution is `renderAsync` here, which will probably be done in the future.
 *
 * @param process - The callback that will be called every time a new element has been reached.
 *
 * For components, this is going to be called, most of the time, two times. This is because the best
 * approach is to process *both* before rendering the components (i.e. on the props.children of a component element)
 * and after rendering them because the children themselves might have been modified in the component's
 * rendering.
